aid:tech,blockchain-based cash transfers for refugees,We started AIDTech to offer better transparency in international aid and support services for refugees migrants and those in need. We want to offer a solution to the problem of financial inclusion for those who are currently excluded from public financial and digital services because they are unbanked or undocumented. Using blockchain based technology allows for direct entitlements and complete traceability and transparency. The problem we are solving is firstly that of financial inclusion. Once a beneficiary is registered on our platform via our partners such as the Red Cross the UN or governmental welfare depts they gain a access to a diverse variety of services. Through access to an accredited personal profile beneficiary can lay claim to services such as capital insurance pensions donations and remittances. This serves as the basis towards more equitable basic human rights and access. Using the example of a smallholding farmer by establishing a legal identity (SDG 16.9) documented on the blockchain their profile serves to host entitlements such as land registry records insurance and remittances.

VipiCash Norway,Blockchain-based money transfer platform,"Imagine if every time you took $100 from you bank account you were only left with $60 without knowing why? This happens to countless immigrants and aid donors who send money to Africa, resulting in billions of dollars in money lost. Many in our team have first hand insight into the challenge of sending money to Africa and deeply understand the burning platform for change. MISSION:To be the number one choice for remittance and aid to Africa, our mission is to help people share their opportunities, no matter where they are at a reasonable cost and more safe way. THE PROBLEM:Year about US $40 billions is sent to Africa through remittance and aid yet only 60% reaches the destination. The rest disappears from mismanagement, corruption, distribution costs, and high charge of sending remittances home as a result of stronger anti-money laundering and anti-terror financing regulations in the global financial system. THE SOLUTION: A platform that increases the value and reach of money sent home by providing tracking and transparency when transferring funds. THE PRODUCT: A solution that guarantees the desired outcome of the payment via an e-voucher locked into goods or service, which can then be received by the beneficiaries at any of the certified VipiCash vendor across in the receiving country in exchange for a code generated from system. A vendor needs to be registered with a verified account on VipiCash to accept these vouchers. GOAL:VipiCash is targeting the Africa’s estimated $40 billion sent to through remittance and aid to ensure they are spent in the right way and making sure that the funds are making a different in the development of the African economy. Team :Founded February 10th, 2017, today we have 6 full-time and 3 part members of staff which include a, development team, business management and marketing team based in Oslo and 4 team members based in Africa.

Lokalist,Lokalist is developing a machine learning platform that can determine the value of an item on your local secondhand market. - Why: It is difficult to determine how much an item should cost on the secondhand market; causing many people to lose money when they go to sell stuff they do not use anymore. This problem is further exaggerated for people who buy and sell secondhand items professionally. - - What is our solution: We are developing an AI that can determine the value of an item on your local secondhand market by automatically aggregating and cleaning public pricing data from local secondhand markets. This allows us to give a more accurate picture of a specific items ideal price; demand; and potential margins. With this information; we can begin revealing this data through a simple interface to help our users make smarter decisions and avoid the costs of lost revenues. - - What are the 3 main challenges we face to make this a success? - 1. Price is currently very individualistic Since price is currently so vague and a lot of it has to deal with emotions as well as data; it will be interesting to see how we can develop ways to overcome the inherent differences we all possess on how much something is worth. I do believe there are ways to provide individual pricing to different people much like the airline industry is able to offer different flight prices to different people but it is a much larger challenge that would come at a later stage. - - 2. Purchasing items will cost money Our plan to initially buy and sell items for profit to support our development will require an initial capital investment. We have raised some money; and my background is in the space where I had a proven history of accurately and effectively profiting from items I was trying to sell; but it requires that I have to focus time; energy; and money on this part of the business to ensure its success. - - 3. Current 3rd party data is very unstructured Developing a way of automating the price discovery of an item is quite difficult due to the very nature of the way people upload items for sale. Often times they leave out key details; ask people to make an offer; or list a price that is not the actual price they would accept and these variables could affect the outcome of the price our AI determines to be correct. Developing ways to automate clean up; and account for these inaccuracies automatically will be a major focus as we develop features to automate our product further. - - What we need to get there - We are currently looking to raise capital; ideally from a syndicated round of smart money angels. Our goal will be to develop our story and product to deliver upon what I call our Minimum Viable Story or “MVS” below: - - We are out to automatically determine the value of any item on your local secondhand market; currently we have developed a way to accurately determine the value of any smartphone; and we are using this ability to support our team as we develop and expand to other categories of items where we feel we have the ability to do the same thing. We are seeking partners and investors that could help us speed up our ability to accomplish this task. - - Using this MVS we plan to land an investment within the next 18 months by convincing investors of our ability to accurately determine the value of a smartphone and laying out the path to expand to other categories; all the while laying out the potential value of this solution to our target customers over the next 3-5 years,,https://www.lokalist.dk/,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production,,,,,,,,Big Data Machine Learning,B2C,Developed Markets,,Nascent,Yes,Seed,,,,,Denmark,,2017,6,,,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent

Trifilon,The ways we currently make; use; reuse; and discard plastics are unsustainable. But many of the products they make improve our lives and livelihoods in ways that fit into an idea of sustainable society.

ImagineCargo,ImagineCargo is reducing the emissions of logistics,"Our approach is to completely re-design the transportation network for carrying packages so that negative impacts are engineered-out of the process. By providing software solutions, replacing trucks, airplanes and vans with bikes, trikes and train, we can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 99%. We believe we are the first to design a complete international package delivery network with minimised external impacts as a fundamental principle. Combined with per shipment optimisation for CO2 emissions we do everything we can to transport every package with minimum impact, while keeping prices and transit times competitive with customer expectations. We will also display the (specific, per package) CO2 saving on package labels so that everyone who handles the package is made aware of the reduced impact. We are working on the following to revolutionize how logistics is done: *Operative Logistics* We've developed an operating concept for city logistics services using high-capacity cargo bikes/trikes to replace significant numbers of delivery trucks in congested city centres contributing large reductions in CO2, particulate, NOx, noise, accidents and other external impacts connected with trucks. With years of experience in the logistics sector we operate a sustainable logsitics network in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and are currently working on expanding it throughout Europe. We go as far as offering solutions for *Software Development* We're currently developing software that will enable us and our network to automatically dispatch shipments to be transported as efficiently as possible, both ecologically and economically. Alongside GPS-data and nodes, CO2-emssion and working conditions will be measured and displayed in the software to give a more detailed track&trace than what we're used to from other integrators. Our ultimate goal is to be able to provide our own operation as well as our network with a full-fledged software package giving us the competitive edge over conventional providers. *Engineering* For our own fleets as well as for our network we're working on a Predictive Maintenance solution for professional sustainable logistics vehicles. To be able to operate large fleets of relatively light vehicles it is essential to have a working maintenance and service plan. To be able to predict defects and service intervals we're working on a cost effective sensor array backed by an AI.

Movildrive,"Movilidad Eléctrica Conectada para trabajadores de PYMES, Autónomos y usuarios Particulares","MovilDrive es una empresa creada en Marzo de 2018 para el desarrollo de software de aplicaciones de móvil en los sectores tecnológicos más disruptivos de hoy en día como ""Connected-Car"", ""Smart-City"" y ""ADAS"" ADAS proviene de Autonomous Driving Assistance Systems, y es el sector en el que se ha formado el socio fundador CEO de MovilDrive, Alberto Lebrón durante los últimos años en Alemania. El objetivo fundamental es el de crear innovación a través del desarrollo Software. Por eso, hemos detectado varios problemas de hoy en día en el centro de Madrid (y en otras grandes ciudades) y hemos comenzado a desarrollar una primera solución para ayudar a resolver este reto. En el sitio web: https://movildrive.com/soluciones.html planteamos nuestra primera solución básica para PYMES y Autónomos para Android / iOS. Se trata de un Car-Sharing eléctrico con vehículos grandes para trabajadores de PYMES y Autónomos y tambíen para particulares. El modelo de negocio está basado en un Car-Sharing, muy extendido en los últimos años, que se podría segmentar entre particulares y empresas. El mercado está validado por diversos estudios y conocidas firmas de consultoría y muestra oportunidad de negocio hasta 2030 debido a las nuevas leyes sobre contaminación CO2 y las normativas europeas para fabricar vehículos eléctricos de todas las marcas :) Aún no existe una solución de Van-Sharing para pequeños empresarios y autónomos que tienen que hacer sus repartos o realizar sus servicios cada diario en el centro de Madrid y Barcelona, y esto les crea un problema a la hora de moverse, encontrar aparcamiento y acceso al centro. Además de las multas que estos pequeños empresarios tienen que ""pagar por trabajar"" que hace que las performance de sus negocios y sus ganancias se vean afectadas, repercutiendo directamente al bolsillo de los responsables del negocio a final de mes. Por eso planteamos esta primera solución, para ayudar a los trabajadores de todos los sectores PYMES, y donde cubriremos usuarios profesionales, autónomos y usuarios particulares que podrán usar nuestras furgonetas eléctricas por la ciudad a diaria y los fines de semana. Una de las ventajas competitivas que ofrecemos respecto a otras empresas es la posibilidad de desarrollar una App con Inteligencia Artificial y Deep-Learning para detectar objetos urbanos y envíar notificaciones al usuario y al coche a través de alertas en su Smart-Phone. (Sector Connected-Car y Smart-City) Otro posible uso sería para aseguradores donde podríamos guardar datos de conducción del usuario (de la flota o empresa) identificando situaciones de distracción al volante y conducciones irregulares para avisar al conductor a través de alertas e indicar medidas más seguras al volante. La primera App básica ya está en Google Play y ha sido desarrollada por el fundador junto con dos becarios de programación, y en un tiempo record hemos integrado una solución completa de car-sharing, con monitoreo y tracking de vehículos en Tiempo Real. El primer vehículo Movildrive también está ya disponible y tiene más de 10 usuario en menos de 1 mes: https://movildrive.com/comofunciona.html En adelante queremos ampliar nuestro equipo para traer con nosotros a desarrolladores de Java y de iOS que tengan experiencia en Machine Learning, además de un técnico de Márketing y SEO para llevar a cabo nuestras primeras campañas de márketing online y publicidad. Aunque nuestro primer Movildrive es una Berlingo Eléctrica, dejaremos al inversor que elija el modelo de furgón eléctrico en el que quiere invertir (Nissan NV200, Peugeot Partner Eléctrica, Kangoo ZE, etc) Nuestro Pitch-Deck para el primer MVP en fase Seed cuenta únicamente con los gastos de estos desarrolladores que se incorporen para ayudar al desarrollo de las App más avanzadas, y la primera flota de 10 vehículos. Las primeras figuras KPI de Julio 2018 aseguran la rentabilidad del negocio, y aunque aún es muy pronto para hacer un analisis finaciero, establece un retorno de la inversión mínimo del 50% sin haber hecho ninguna campaña de marketing ni de publicidad en estos momentos. Al Break-Even o Punto de Equilibrio se llegaría en menos de tres años, ofreciendo rentabilidad a partir del primer día, y desde ese momento solo ganancia, con vehículos eléctricos con poco mantenimiento y tan solo un recambio de las baterías entre los 5-7 años.

Climeon,BUSINESS FOR A BETTER WORLD - Doing good for the environment has been a central part of Climeon since the company was founded; and achieving the objective by enabling profitable business for the customer has served as a guiding principle throughout the development of Climeon&#039;s Heat Power system. The environmental benefits consists of: - - Significant energy savings - A Climeon Heat Power module (150kW) can generate enough clean electricity per year to provide up to 263 typical Swedish detached houses with household electricity. With 100 000 modules installed; the emissions of up to 98 million tonnes CO2 would be avoided annually. A forest the size of Denmark would be required in order to absorb the same amount of CO2 annually. - - Minor environmental impact in the manufacturing process: - All renewable energy technology impacts the environment negatively during manufacturing. For example; large amounts of steel and energy are used to manufacture a wind farm. The power plant needs to be in operation a certain amount of time to compensate for the negative impact the manufacturing has had on the environment - what is known as the environmental payback time. For renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar power; the environmental payback time is around six and 18 months; respectively. The production of Climeon Heat Power system requires approximately 40 000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of energy. Hence the module needs up to 15 days to compensate for the amount of energy used in production; resulting in an environmental payback time of less than two weeks.,,https://climeon.com/,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy,,,,,,Energy & Materials,Resource recovery; Energy efficiency - energy intensive industries,The Circular Economy,B2B,Developed Markets,,Emerging,,,,,,,Sweden,Stockholm,2011,37,,,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,Duplicate or 1st occurrence,,0.5,0.66,0.5,0.596,Emerging

climeworks,capturing co2 from air,"climeworks has developed a way to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air. the concentrated gas is then either sold for commercial products such as carbonated beverages, or safely buried to directly reduce atmospheric concentrations. climeworks’ direct air capture technology captures co2 from ambient air with a patented filter, in a device called the ‘co2 collector’. air is drawn into the collector, and the co2 within the air is chemically bound to the filter. once the filter is saturated with co2 it is heated to around 100°c, which causes the co2 to be released from the filter so it can be collected as highly concentrated co2 gas. the remaining co2-free air is released back into the atmosphere. the concentrated co2 gas is either sold for commercial applications such as carbonated drinks, agriculture and alternative fuels, or it is safely sequestered in icelandic rock formations, contributing to the removal of co2 from the atmosphere. climeworks plants are modular, scalable and can be mass-produced, enabling deployment on a large scale. because the plants capture co2 from air, they can be built anywhere, independently of any existing infrastructure. why you should care the paris agreement signed by 196 nations in 2015 agreed to keep the global average increase in temperatures to ‘well below two degrees celsius’, but the un environment’s ‘ gap report ’ suggests that even with the pledges to cut emissions that have been made so far, we are unlikely to meet the target. this suggests there could be an even more significant role for carbon capture technologies going forward.",http://www.climeworks.com/,SDG 13: Climate Action,,13.6 Engineered Solutions for Carbon Removal,,,,,,,,switzerland,Growth,Mature,Yes,Series C,$36.4M,>20M,,High income,Switzerland,,2009,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,Duplicate or 1st occurrence,,1,0.66,0,0.796,Mature

Asaduru,Creating sustainable buildings using rammed earth and cleantech solutions,"Today buildings consume at least 32% of global energy and the construction industry stand for 24% of total GHG-emissions (UN-habitat). However, if the embodied energy of construction materials is included, the share of the building sector is significantly higher and becomes the leading GHG emitter (up to 40% of energy consumption and 30% of GHG emissions). Because of this, the design and construction of buildings have a significant effect on the probabilities of meeting the 2°C target. AsaDuru enables African property developers to create self-sufficient housing communities using rammed earth construction, delivered through an exclusive partnership with the market-leading company Earth Structures Group. Their proprietary formworks allows us to build rammed earth walls, as subcontractors using local and sustainable materials, significantly faster than the closest competitor, while developing our own IP. Rammed earth is one of the most sustainable wall building techniques available (BREEAM A+) with low embodied energy (70% less than fired bricks) and a high thermal mass. Local soil is packed layer by layer within a formwork to create durable, load-bearing walls. In certain markets, such as Kenya, our rammed earth system is already significantly cheaper than the cheapest alternatives (concrete blocks & bricks). AsaDuru will build on this foundation by including solutions that allow a holistic approach to building, including wastewater treatment, rainwater harvesting and renewable energy. Combined, these elements will build homes which produce their own water and energy and deal with their own waste. This is a concept we are calling NZero.

dyecoo,waterless dyeing of textiles using co2,"dyecoo offers a co2-based dyeing technology that eliminates the need for water and processing chemicals in the dyeing process of fabrics and also reduces energy consumption. this technology uses co2 for dyeing polyester fabrics, and has already been embraced by major brands such as ikea and nike. dyecoo textile systems release liquid co2 into the dye vessels of the machine, where heat and pressure transform the liquid co2 into a supercritical fluid that is used to dye fabrics. the machine then lowers the heat and pressure, and the co2 leaves the dye vessels as a gas. in the process, 95% of the co2 is recovered and stored as liquid ready for reuse, which makes dyecoo an almost closed-loop technology. the result is that no processing water or chemicals are required, with a 50% reduction in energy consumption for the process. moreover, the process is substantially quicker than conventional textile dyeing methods. why you should care between 17 and 20% of industrial water pollution is generated by textile dyeing processes, and the industry continues to cause environmental stress on the water resources in developing countries. this co2-based dyeing process offers a sustainable alternative to conventional water-based dyeing process, in which up to 700 liters of freshwater are typically required to finish just one kg of textiles. in addition, dyecoo’s process lowers operational costs by up to 45% compared to conventional textile dying, according to the company.",http://www.dyecoo.com/,SDG 13: Climate Action,,13.6 Engineered Solutions for Carbon Removal,,,,,,,,Netherlands,Unknown,Emerging,Yes,Series A,Undisclosed,N/A,,High income,Netherlands,,2008,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,1,0.33,0,0.598,Emerging
groasis,growing trees in deserts with minimal water use,"the groasis growboxx plant cocoon allows plants and trees to grow in desert areas using limited water resources, without continuous energy or irrigation demand. the groasis growboxx plant cocoon is a planting technology for eroded, rocky, dry and desert areas that allows growth of a single tree, or a tree in combination with four other plants. it is filled with a one-time dose of 15 liters of water, which is prevented from evaporating by the design of the box. instead, water is slowly released into the soil surrounding the seeds. rain and condensation from the surroundings are also collected in the box. in this way, a heavy rain shower of just 10 minutes once a year can be stored and apportioned to the plant until the following season. if the two billion hectares of man-made deserts were small enough to cut, it is certainly small enough to replant. pieter hoff – founder, groasis the box releases only 50 ml of water per day. with such a limited amount of water, the plants are forced to search deeper into the ground and over time – even in the driest areas – the roots typically find water within just a few feet. once the plants have established a root system, the box biodegrades, encouraging further growth and creating a cradle-to-cradle product. why you should care according to the company, the average survival rate for the trees is over 90%, no matter how challenging the circumstances. likewise, water savings are more than 90% compared to any other planting method during the first year. from the second year onwards, water savings become 100% as no water is artificially added.",https://www.groasis.com/en,SDG 13: Climate Action,,13.6 Engineered Solutions for Carbon Removal,,,,,,,,Netherlands,Go-to-market,Mature,,,,N/A,,High income,Netherlands,,2003,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,https://goexplorer.org/growing-trees-in-deserts-with-minimal-water-use/,1,0.66,0,0.796,Mature
land life company,biodegradable tree incubators for mass reforestation,"the cocoon is a biodegradable tree incubator, designed to provide seedlings with shelter and water and give them a higher chance of survival in degraded ecosystems. the cocoon is a donut-shaped pot that is designed to protect seedlings during their first year of growth – the time when they are most vulnerable. the cocoon is made from recycled paper pulp, and is completely biodegradable. the seedling sits in the centre of the pot in a protective shelter, making it less exposed to animals and harsh weather conditions. the pot around the seedling holds 25 litres of water, and wicking technology slowly transports the water from the outer container into the protective shelter. this provides a stable source of water for the seedling during early growth when the seedling is establishing root structures to find groundwater. this is particularly critical in areas where there is little rainfall, as without secure water access, plants often die before they are able to develop roots deep enough to discover water beneath the surface. land life have already commenced projects in over 25 countries. for instance, in australia they partnered with the university of new south wales to reforest a former mine site. australia’s gold rush, which took place during the 1850s, left an unfortunate legacy of over 50,000 unrestored mine sites. the two organisations planted two types of native australian trees – eucalyptus and casuarina trees – in the former mine site using the cocoon technology. despite harsh weather conditions and dry soils, 90% of the seedlings have survived. why you should care at present, there are over two billion hectares of land on earth that have suffered from degradation. reforesting arid areas is challenging due to harsh conditions, dry soils and inconsistent rainfall. conventional reforestation techniques in these areas may rely on irrigation, which can be expensive and water intensive. reforestation can bring numerous benefits to the environment and to people. it can protect the watershed, prevent erosion and landslides, and act as a natural carbon sink. in addition, forests can provide livelihoods, shelter, food and medicine for rural communities.",https://www.landlifecompany.com/,SDG 13: Climate Action,,13.6 Engineered Solutions for Carbon Removal,,,,,,,,Netherlands,Unknown,Nascent,Yes,Series A,$6.61M,3-10M,,High income,Netherlands,,2013,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,0.5,0.33,0,0.398,Nascent

Politicians and corporations are a heavy and slow machinery. The latest driven only by profit. People know this, and they are tired of waiting for solutions, people want to participate and take action. But they are also busy and often too worried about their own issues as per investing their time on planting a tree or riding a bicycle instead of driving their car. Fortunately nowadays technology is accesible for everyone. There are specialized Apps that helps us in every task we can imagine. We look at the weather forecast, consult the stock markets, book hotels, reserve taxis, present boarding passes at the airport, read digital newspapers and will end up connecting online with our doctor. Our smartphone is often the last thing we see before felling asleep and we use it as our clock alarm in the morning. However, how many of us is using its smartphone or tablet to create a better world? Which APP is out there that allows you to become an environmental hero? What is the Company that allows you to plant a forest, to become carbon neutral, to measure your impact in the environment, that reinforces you when you do something positive, that brings you environmental awareness, that even makes your ego grow when you share your heroic acts on social media, that encourages you to actually do it all, but even better: DOES IT FOR YOU! Well, Reforestum is all of it and much more. Reforestum offers a green hub for each individual and company that cares about the planet and the future of humanity, that is aware of the risk we are taking if we don’t come all together against climate change. We offer reforestation and offsetsing services globaly. In a few months we count with 1049 clients from 53 countries and 5 continents. Each time anyone makes use of a taxi ride, a Uber, a flight, a hotel, a car sharing service, electricity, vacations, clothes, document shipping, online shopping… it´s all digital, and we want to connect and funnel it all towards our APP. Let´s talk about an ideal scenario: You take a taxi from Schuman to Zaventen Airport, at the end of your trip the App provides you with a exact calculation: the vehicle has polluted 0,5 Kg of CO2 and then offers you to offset your carbon footprint for a few cents of Euro. If you agree the App will extend the forest that you already own in the north of Belgium in a small fraction. Imagine now that you do the same thing many times during the year, and that at the end of that year the outcome is that you owe rights over 200 sqm of forest, a forest that you can actually visit, that you can track online through the Reforestum App! It´s like a savings box for your grandchildren! And not only that, Reforestum is building an online communty of earth warriors with competitions, badges and more. The App will analyze your lifestlyle and give you advice in order to reduce your ecological footprint. It will congratulate you each time you are closer to neutrality maybe because you walked instead of taking a taxi, or said no to a plastic bag. Of course, the objective is that each one of us can become carbon neutral and that we can all together reforest the world! We are already in business, we have planted a first forest in Spain and have delivered a first version of the online APP. Unexpectedly, some companies came to us in order to offset their emissions, so we are developing a B2B strategy that is already working successfully.

The Ocean Cleanup,autonomous floating systems collect ocean waste,"a 600m-long floating system with a tapered 3-meter-deep skirt has been launched into the pacific ocean to passively collect ocean waste as it is propelled naturally around the great pacific garbage patch. since 2013 dutch inventor boyan slat has dreamed about cleaning up the vast quantities of plastic waste that have accumulated in the ocean. earlier this year, with the help of maersk, his 600-meter long plastic catching device was towed from california, to make a dent in the great pacific garbage patch (gpgp) that is wreaking havoc with marine biological systems. the gpgp is the largest accumulation of ocean plastic in the world at around 1.6 million square kilometres and is located between hawaii and california. it is designed with flexibility, scalability and passivity in mind. it follows the natural wind and ocean current flows, exactly as floating plastic would, to reach the same areas where plastic waste congregates in the oceans. the float sits higher in the water than much of the plastic waste, meaning that it is blown faster than the waste can travel, thus collecting waste as it moves through the water. the skirt that sits beneath the float was designed to collect plastic while allowing marine life to pass underneath, creating minimal disturbance. the skirt is also tapered in such a way to create a natural u-shape for the system so that the waste is collected in one place and can be systematically removed by the garbage trucks of the ocean. why you should care ocean debris has been building up at an alarming rate, but the distant nature of the problem means that people are less likely to perceive it as a pressing problem. that is not however the case for marine life. the ocean cleanup’s long-term ambition is to install at least 60 systems, with the aim of removing half of the 80,000 tonnes of plastic in the great pacific garbage patch within five years.",https://www.theoceancleanup.com/?gclid=eaiaiqobchmi_9okkygz3qivjcqych39lgw_eaayasaaegipv_d_bwe,SDG 14: Life Below Water,,14.1 Marine Cleanup Technologies,,,,,,,,Netherlands,Growth,Nascent,Yes,Undisclosed,,N/A,,High income,Netherlands,,2012,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,Duplicate or 1st occurrence,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent

Just Vertical,Unleashing urban farmers,"At Just Vertical we make the planet and you healthier while minimizing your environmental footprint. We unleash your inner farmer with our easy to use produce growing system. Take the guess work out of gardening and turn any living room, kitchen, office, or closet into your mini-farm. Just Vertical is a hydroponics rental and sales company with an innovative business model and technology. We are committed to our goal of eliminating 8 billion food miles before the 8 billionth person is born. Our business model is based around overcoming the barriers that urbanites have engaging with hydroponic farming, namely cost, capabilities, and physical space. We meet all these challenges through our reoccurring revenue model of renting systems out instead of selling them while packaging them with our seedlings to overcome capabilities gaps. Our technology itself is sleek, aesthetic, and takes up less square footage while remaining incredibly productive. Under the current iteration of our system we have managed to grow produce faster than in field conditions while using significantly less inputs. Our system is 95-99% more water efficient than traditional systems while using no pesticides. Our vision for Just Vertical is based around doing well by doing good. We are also pioneering hydroponic plant research into hops, quinoa, and arctic growing. We have prioritized our ability to continue to drive research and development even in the hectic world of start-ups. Additionally, we strongly believe in the potential of our technology and our company to make the world a better place through reducing others sustainability footprints. The next big step we want to take with IKEA is bringing the cost down to bring our healthy and environmentally positive growing to as many people as possible. Right now we have absolutely nailed the plant science and are pioneers in that field. However, the hardware we use to grow the plants in is currently too expensive to be accessible to anything more than the wealthy. We need to change this and IKEA is the perfect partner to do this with. Currently we can produce plants for as little as half a cent ($0.005). This enables us to provide healthy, nutritious food to customers at a fraction of the cost of traditional grocery stores. Now we need to perfect the home growing system in order to truly enable everybody on the planet to be able to grow their own healthy, environmentally friendly, produce.",http://www.justvertical.com,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.1 AgTech for Sustainable Farming,,,,,,,,Canada,Go-to-market,Nascent,Yes,Seed,Undisclosed,N/A,,High income,Canada,,2017,,,IKEA Bootcamp,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent

Sense Grass,Digitalizing Agriculture,"Agriculture was the strongest pillar of Indian economy. But over the years, the contribution of Agriculture in GDP has considerably fallen. There are hundreds of problem with Indian Agriculture which include Lack of Technology, Lack of mechanization but the major problem but the major problem lack of effective measures on Pest Control. Approximately 10% of the Foodgrains, 15% of the Pulse crops and 30% of the fruits are lost to pests, Currently, farmers use pesticides to kill these pests but over spray those resources which lead to extra cost of Pesticides, loss of fertility of Soil and problems to humans due to huge amounts of chemical being added. Our mission is to cut input costs of the Indian farmer by helping farmers monitor pests, diseases, and weeds. Sense Grass is a precision agriculture platform for pest control. We will offer CLIMATO, a mobile application and a geo-based big-data engine that reduces the usage of pesticides based on actionable information. We will provide a decision support technology offering farmers a relatively simple data aggregation and pest management tool. Its application enables to monitor pests, diseases, and weeds; view areas affected by pests and weeds, find blind areas and routes, and control scouting; and monitor the effectiveness of sprayings over pest population, and control tank mixture, as well as maintain track/record date, time, site, crop protectants used, and climate conditions. The company’s software application enables technicians to record their activities in the field, as well as interprets and then displays the data in the report and on the maps. It serves co-operatives and dealers, consultants, and farmers. This platform creates value by taking the information collected by scouts on the field to be evaluated by crop consultants and acted upon by growers. Our mobile application allows growers to track information related to crop conditions such as pests, diseases, and weeds. We decided to launch this product because we are engaged in a mission to make agriculture more efficient, profitable and more sustainable. My grandfather was a wheat grower in the north India, and I grew up watching his ups and downs in agriculture.

Soil absorbs water until it reaches field capacity. Roots in contact or proximity with the tank, dry the soil, thus leeching water out of the block by capillary force. 40-60% Water savings: savings in deposits and infrastructures for the farmer and for irrigation groups (State-Region). Savings avoiding deep infiltration, savings avoiding evaporation, the plant only takes by capillarity what it needs. Close to 100% efficiency. 40-50% Fertilizer saving: the fertilizer is dissolved in the irrigation water. 20-40% Phytosanitary saving: No water-logging is generated in the soil, so this prevents the germination of weeds and the proliferation of pests and diseases. 20-40% Saves energy by reducing the volume of water to be pumped, transported. Labor saving, the reduction of wetness in soil avoids the proliferation of weeds that need not be removed, it also reduces costs of eliminating such waste. Reducing fertilizer use improves the saturation of nitrates in the sea and aquifers. It does not need high pressure so the energy bill is reduced in some cases. Reducing water use: reduces salinization of soil and aquifers by marine intrusion. Less humidity is generated in greenhouses so there are fewer fungal infections and less condensation. Reduction of phytosanitary treatments. The plant only takes the water it needs and when it needs it.

aqutonix,water efficiency gives more crop per drop,"aqutonix is a water efficiency enhancement technology that facilitates the absorption of the water in plants’ roots, reducing water consumption and boosting yields. due to water’s chemical properties, molecules tend to group together in ‘clusters’ which have to be broken down by the plant before the individual molecules can be absorbed through the roots’ cell walls. aqutonix’s technology facilitates water absorption through exposure to a high voltage electric field which breaks the clusters down, making individual molecules available to plants. increasing absorption rates means that less water is required, resulting in water savings for farmers. what’s more, the product increases the photosynthetic efficiency of plants – because the water molecules are broken down before they are consumed by the plant, it leaves the plant more energy for photosynthesis. this process has been shown to increase yields by up to 43% . the device is compatible with existing commercial irrigation systems, making it easy to install. although it runs on electricity, it requires very little, around 500 watts per hour. the company expects that savings on water usage will make up for the extra energy costs, and may reduce them overall if farms have to irrigate less. why you should care agriculture is currently responsible for 70% of global freshwater consumption. what’s more, agricultural run-off from inefficient irrigation and excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides can contaminate groundwater and freshwater sources. aqutonix can help overcome these issues by cutting water consumption and reliance on agricultural chemicals.",http://aqutonix.com/,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.1 AgTech for Sustainable Farming,,,,,,,,United States of America,Go-to-market,Mature,,,,N/A,,High income,USA,,,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,1,0.66,0,0.796,Mature

essento,bug burgers brought to swiss supermarkets,"essento’s insect-based meat alternatives seek to change the way europeans think about eating bugs, and reduce the environmental footprint of meat-heavy diets. according to the food and agriculture organisation (fao), more than two billion people already consume insects on a regular basis, yet across europe they’re still considered pretty gross. by processing insects into a range of insect burgers and balls, essento hope to bring these nutritious food sources into the european diet. since the swiss government revised their food safety laws in 2017 to permit insect-based foods to be sold, essento has partnered with major supermarket chain coop to bring insects into the spotlight. eating insects can bring major health benefits. they’re full of important vitamins and minerals, like vitamin b12, iron and calcium. they supply a similar amount of protein per weight to fish and other meat sources, as well as essential fatty acids found in avocados, nuts and fatty fish. aside from the health benefits, insect-based meat alternatives have a much lower environmental footprint than conventional animal products. per kilogram of equivalent edible protein, they produce less than 20 kg of co2 equivalent, compared with 120 kg from beef. in addition, they consume far less water and one-tenth of the feed of beef, meaning they place much less strain on the earth’s resources. why you should care the western meat-centred diet is one of the most significant factors in our environmental footprint. it contributes to land degradation and deforestation, diverts food and water away from human consumption and drives up food prices, and causes undue suffering to sentient animals. insects could be an important protein source that demands fewer resources and energy.",https://essento.ch/,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.4 New Protein Sources,,,,,,,,europe,Growth,Emerging,,,,N/A,,High income,Switzerland,,2013,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,0.5,0.66,0,0.596,Emerging

snact,a delicious protest against food waste,"snact has developed a range of fruit-based snacks made from produce that would otherwise have been wasted, helping to reduce food waste and provide healthy snack options. snact rescues produce that fails to meet cosmetic standards and turns it into healthy snack bars. these products have a longer shelf-life than fresh fruit, reducing the volumes of food waste. their first product was fruit jerky, a dried fruit snack made with 100% fruit and nothing else. they’ve since launched banana bars made with some of the 1.4 million bananas that go to waste in the uk every day. in britain where the company is based, supermarkets are the main customer for farmers, and impose strict guidelines on what constitutes acceptable fruit. if a banana is too wonky, an apple too blemished, or a carrot too kinky, the supermarkets reject the produce and the fruit goes to waste, despite no issues with taste or nutritional value. the company has also developed packaging for their snack bars that will biodegrade in six months, taking inspiration from nature’s own packing – the banana skin – and helping to ensure their product does not have a negative environmental consequence after consumption. why you should care around 1.4 million bananas alone are wasted in the uk every day. snact focuses between the farmers or wholesalers and the supermarkets, to produce ‘less waste, more taste’.",https://snact.co.uk/,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.6 Other,,,,,,,,global,Growth,Nascent,Yes,Seed,Undisclosed,N/A,,High income,United Kingdom,,2013,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent

regrained,crafting new uses for brewery byproducts,"supergrain+ is a flour made from the ‘spent grain’, a byproduct of brewing beers. this fibre and protein rich flour is converted into nutritious snack bars wrapped in biodegradable packaging. regrained was founded by two friends with a hobby for home brewing beer. upon realising the vast amount of grain that is wasted in the brewing process, referred to as ‘spent grain’, they set out to develop a way to create value from this nutritious byproduct. the result is supergrain+, an alternative to flour that is produced using spent grain from local craft breweries around san francisco. in the brewing process, grains such as barley, wheat and rye are mixed with hot water to extract most of their sugars and create alcohol. without these starches, the remaining byproduct is packed with insoluble fibre, protein and micronutrients. in fact, supergrain+ contains 20g of protein and 27g of fibre per 100g, compared to 12g and 3g respectively in plain white flour. it is also a good source of prebiotics, the nutrients that feed probiotics in the gut and promote digestive health. supergrain+ is currently sold in the form of flavoured snack bars, but regrained is experimenting with other products such as chips and bread. to date, they’ve upcycled over 20,000kg of grain. regrained has partnered with packaging industry experts to develop a wrapper that is biodegradable and compostable, in keeping with their no-waste philosophy. their solution is part of a growing trend of what the founders call ‘edible upcycling’, whereby the byproducts from food production are transformed into new food products. they are a certified b-corp organisation, meaning they have been independently verified as an environmentally and socially responsible company. in addition, they are a member of the 1% for the planet movement and donate 1% of their profits to non-profit organisations. why you should care traditionally, spent grain has been collected by farmers and fed to livestock. however the growth of urban craft breweries means that this valuable byproduct is not conveniently available to farmers, meaning it is disposed of using municipal waste services. regrained has discovered a use to recover further value from this nutritious byproduct and cut food waste.",https://www.regrained.com/,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,,2.6 Other,,,,,,,,United States of America,Unknown,Emerging,,,,N/A,,High income,USA,,2017,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,0.5,0.66,0,0.596,Emerging

Derfor spurgte hun bl.a. Sarah; som stod som medicinstuderende på 6. semester; om hun havde det pågældende kittelkort; som hun måtte låne. Men det havde hun ikke; for hun havde jo ikke været i KBU endnu og havde derfor ikke den samme adgang til disse tilsyneladende gode og anvendelige kittelkort; lommekort og actioncards. - - Det endte så med at den yngre læge forlod patienten; for at finde en anden KBU læge; som også havde kittelkortene; hvorefter hun kunne færdiggøre sin behandling af den akutte patient. - - Sådan kom ideen til MyMedCards.,,http://www.mymedcards.dk,SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being,,,,,,Health & Wellbeing,Telehealth; Better disease management; Electronic medical records,Lean Service Models,B2B,Developed Markets,,Nascent,No,Unfunded,,,,,Denmark,,2016,,,,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent

Octlight ApS,Millions Of People Have Impaired Vision Due To Late Diagnosis - Today; more than 10% of the world’s population over the age of 60 has age-related macular degeneration which causes vision loss and leads to blindness. According to the World Health Organization (WHO): “285 million people worldwide are visually impaired: 39 million are blind and 246 have low vision. 80% of all visual impairment can be avoided or cured”. Early diagnosis and follow-up treatments is necessary to prevent eye diseases from turning into blindness. - Early diagnosis is limited by the ability to make 3D OCT images of the eye. OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique used extensively by eye specialists to obtain cross-sectional images of the eye for diagnosis and treatment. Today; it is only possible to make partial 3D OCT images of the eye as the eye constantly moves. The current technology is not fast enough to take a full image of the eye within those small movements. Full 3D OCT images of the eye is necessary to assess the condition of the eye and to ensure that nothing is overlooked.

the seabin project,floating seabin collects ocean waste,"the seabin is a rubbish bin that floats in the water and collects litter, using a sucking mechanism to collect and filter debris in marinas, docks and ports. if we have rubbish bins on land, why not have them in the oceans? trying to find an answer to his own question caused andrew ‘turtle’ turtons to team up with fellow boat builder pete ceglins and invent a ‘seabin’ – a floating rubbish bin that cleans docks and ports by collecting trash, oil, fuel, detergents and microplastics. in 2015, the two australian founders set sail on their self-stated mission: saving the oceans. temporarily switching out surfboards for a drawing board, they invented the floating rubbish bins that can draw in and collect 1.5 kg debris per day, with a total capacity of 20 kg. a submersive water pump, capable of displacing 25,000 litres per hour, sucks water and floating debris towards the seabin, which then filters it through a ‘catchbag’, leaving the waste in the seabin to be collected when full. the seabin can be purchased online and currently requires an electrical connection to the grid, in order to power the pump that draws water and trash towards the seabin. the company is aiming to develop a version that uses alternative energy sources such as solar, wave or wind power so the seabins can roam the open oceans as well. why you should care in a year, one seabin is capable of collecting the equivalent of 90,000 plastic bags or 35,700 disposable cups. this can help to address the the ocean waste that grows bigger by a garbage truck every minute . the company recognises the importance of addressing the problem at the source and securing proper waste management.",http://seabinproject.com/,SDG 14: Life Below Water,,14.1 Marine Cleanup Technologies,,,,,,,,global,Growth,Nascent,Yes,Series A,$1M,N/A,,High income,Spain,,2015,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,0.5,0.33,0,0.398,Nascent

CO2 Revolution,Revolución tecnológica contra el cambio climático. Creamos ecosistemas mediante semillas inteligentes (iseed) lanzadas en drones,"El cambio climático es uno de los mayores, quizá el mayor, problema al que se enfrenta la humanidad. Las principales causas del mismo son la emisión de gases de efecto invernadero y la deforestación masiva. Solucionar estas dos causas pasa a ser uno de los principales objetivos globales si queremos que la vida, tal cual la conocemos, no cambie de forma drástica en las próximas décadas. Nuestro producto / servicio intenta dar una solución que ataca a la raíz de ambas causas, aplicando un método de innovación tecnológica para crear ecosistemas a gran escala. Ecosistemas que por una parte recuperen, mediante su proceso natural, enormes cantidades de carbono en estado gaseoso de la atmósfera y lo transformen en estado sólido y por otra, reforesten enormes cantidades de terreno deforestado para que anualmente la superficie total neta forestada tenga saldo positivo. Hemos concebido la creación de un ecosistema analizando todas las variables que interviene en la creación del mismo, como si de la línea de producción de una fábrica se tratase, eliminado todos los cuellos de botella generalmente ligados a tiempo y dinero El sistema consta de 4 fases: 1. Big Data. Se trata de un programa informático, que mediante algoritmos selecciona de unas enormes bases de datos las variables más apropiadas para el nuevo ecosistema. Se analizan y seleccionan variables tales como temperatura, precipitaciones, tipos de suelo, especies autóctonas, requerimientos de las poblaciones locales y las optimiza y ajusta para crear ecosistemas armónicos, sostenibles y productivos. 2. Iseed (semilla inteligente). Innovación mundial. Se trata de una semilla pregerminada, a la que se saca de su periodo de latencia, la cual se introduce dentro de una cápsula biodegradable a la que se añaden todos los elementos que necesita dicha semilla para que tenga viabilidad en su primera fase de crecimiento, que es la más crítica. Se añaden elementos como enraizantes, abonos orgánicos, repelentes para posibles depredadores o polímeros superabsorventes que aumentan hasta 500 veces su tamaño en contacto con agua y que hacen que no falte humedad a la futura planta. Eficiencia superior al 80%. 3. Drones. La plantación se realiza mediante drones, que llevan adosados unos depósitos que pueden albergar hasta 2500 de nuestras Iseed en cada vuelo. El lanzamiento de cada Iseedla realiza en dron siguiendo lo diseñado y marcado por el Big Data (apartado 1). Apoyado en la guía GPS, los mapas cartografiados y su software propio va realizando el lanzamiento de cada Iseed de forma autónoma. Un sólo dron puede plantar más de 25000 potenciales árboles en un sólo día, algo inimaginable a día de hoy. 4. Plataforma digital.

kitemill,airborne wind energy captures high altitude wind power,"kitemill has developed a technology that harnesses airborne wind energy at high altitudes using a kite. airborne wind energy is a renewable energy technology whereby a kite, attached to the ground by a tether, is moved by winds at a high altitude. unlike conventional wind turbines, which are usually around 100 metres tall, airborne wind energy technologies can reach an altitude of between 500 to 1500 metres, where winds are both stronger and more consistent. kitemill’s airborne wind energy technology consists of a kite that is similar in design and shape to a commercial aeroplane, meaning it is built to withstand rough conditions at high altitudes. the kite is attached to a ground station by a thin tether. as the kite is carried by the wind, energy is generated as the tether is pulled, transferring the energy from the kite to the power generator in the ground station. the kite is fitted with an intelligent control system which uses multiple sensors to ensure that the kite flies at an altitude where energy production conditions are optimal. the company have produced a prototype and estimate that due to lower costs than offshore wind turbines, their technology can offer lower levelised cost of energy compared to current onshore and offshore wind, once they scale up operations. it also allows landlocked countries to access wind energy in their decarbonisation efforts. why you should care wind power has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, now accounting for more than 11% of electricity demand in the eu and 4% of the world in total . however, constructing wind turbines is resource intensive and expensive to install and maintain. awe technology uses approximately 90% fewer resources per watt to construct than conventional wind turbines.",http://www.kitemill.com/,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy,,7.2 Energy Sources,,,,,,,,norway,Unknown,Nascent,Yes,Seed,$54K,<1M,,High income,norway,,2008,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,Duplicate or 1st occurrence,,1,0,0,0.4,Nascent

absolicon,concentrated solar power,"parabolic solar concentration technology produces a dense form of energy that can be used for heating and cooling, electricity generation, and industrial purposes. absolicon develops and manufactures solar concentration technologies. their products, known as ‘parabolic trough converters’ contain a u-shaped metal basin that reflects and concentrates solar energy. they have two key models, the x10 pvt and the t160, and both are mounted on a mechanism that allows the troughs to move with the sun, maximising the amount of time they are exposed to energy throughout the day. the x10 pvt simultaneously generates electricity and hot water. the concave trough concentrates solar power onto a small strip of solar cells, which is then converted to 230v and can be fed into the electricity grid. meanwhile, hot water up to 75ºc is also generated, which can be used in applications such as district heating. the t160 does not contain photovoltaic solar cells, but instead concentrates the solar rays to heat water up 160ºc that creates steam. this intense source of energy can be used in industrial processes as an alternative to oil and natural gas. absolicon products are designed with scalability and affordability in mind. they are produced using readily available materials so that they can be regionally produced and more quickly distributed, and have already been installed in europe, south america and asia. at present they have robotised production facilities in sweden and sichuan, in china, and are currently looking to expand production to india. why you should care innovations in the design of solar power technologies can help drive down the levelised cost of electricity so that renewables can outcompete fossil fuels. this will lead to drastic reductions in global greenhouse gases emissions from the electricity and heating sectors.",http://www.absolicon.com/,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy,,7.2 Energy Sources,,,,,,,,global,Unknown,Nascent,Yes,Seed,$1.3M,1-3M,,High income,sweden,,2007,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,1,0,0,0.4,Nascent

It will be a challenge for both individual property owners and society in general. The risk is obvious that the power grid; both locally and nationally will be exposed to high loads. This leads to an increased need for investment in new electricity power supply and other infrastructure measures. - - - At the same time an increasing number of electric vehicles charged via the electricity grid will lead to a growing battery capacity for electrical energy. This new resource will also increase the potential for utilising locally produced solar electricity. The load on the grid will be reduced while the potential for new production of solar electricity increases. - Charging points will be certified for using solar electricity primarily from local or owned production. If locally produced solar energy is not available; the charging point will be supplied with solar power from other producers through issued guarantees of origin. Charging electric vehicles at a certified solar charging point can be sure to always get 100% solar. - If a solar power installation is connected directly to the charging points the vehicles can be charged with higher power when the sun is shining; which requires a straight-forward control. The self consumption can be increased and the purchased electricity reduced. With so-called forecast control the charging can also be controlled by the estimated future solar radiation. With Solarcharge Systems charging peak loads can also be avoided during high electricity prices; or when other needs must be prioritised.,,https://www.solelia.se/,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy,,,,,,Energy & Materials,Expansion of renewables,,B2B; B2C,Developed Markets,,Emerging,,,,,,,Sweden,,2011,1,,,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,Duplicate or 1st occurrence,,0.5,0.66,0,0.596,Emerging

sustainer homes,rethinking construction with modular wooden homes,"sustainer homes designs and constructs unique buildings through innovative sustainable design principles and a focus on renewable energy. their buildings are modular, customisable and self-contained to suit a variety of needs, including residential and commercial property. seeking to reduce the environmental impact of the construction industry, sustainer homes has developed a modular system for constructing customisable homes and office buildings. the company uses finnish pine wood as the key material in the building modules, due to its low environmental footprint, versatility and durability. buildings can either be selected from a catalogue of designs or custom-designed using a combination of the company’s different models. each piece of the building is carved out using high precision techniques involving computer-controlled saws. further, each piece has a unique identification code, which speeds up the construction process and means that individual parts can be easily replicated and replaced in case of damage. once the components of the house are cut, they are assembled in a warehouse, meaning there is no delay or damage due to adverse weather conditions (an important consideration in the netherlands). afterwards, the finished pieces are transported to the site, where they are installed in one to two days. energy is a key consideration in their design. each building is fitted with solar panels to provide energy for electricity and heating, and are properly insulated to maximise the energy efficiency of heating and cooling systems. thanks to the integration of renewable energy systems and smart use of materials, sustainer homes estimates that their buildings generate 90% less co₂ emissions than conventionally built properties made from steel and concrete. at present they are only operating in the netherlands, as their buildings are designed to comply with dutch regulatory standards. in the future they intend to extend their services beyond homes and offices, to hotels and even emergency accommodation in off-grid areas. why you should care the way buildings are constructed and used has an enormous impact on resource consumption. construction and demolition in the eu is responsible for between 25-30% of all solid waste created . in addition, buildings consume 40% of energy in the eu and generate 36% of greenhouse gas emissions . therefore, constructing low waste, energy efficient buildings can be an important tool for reducing the construction sector’s environmental footprint in the eu.",https://www.sustainerhomes.nl/,SDG 13: Climate Action,,13.5 Decarbonised Buildings,,,,,,,,Netherlands,Unknown,Nascent,Yes,Seed,,N/A,,High income,Netherlands,,2015,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,Duplicate or 1st occurrence,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent

west african fish,green fish farming fosters local growth,"west african fish run environmentally friendly aquaculture farms in ghana that create jobs and a supply of protein-rich food for local communities. west african fish operates in eastern ghana where the company grows and farms fish by using aquaculture technology. the aquaculture involves cultivating the tilapia fish under controlled conditions, as opposed to most commercial fishing that relies on harvesting wild fish. the main technology employed in the process involves re-circulating and recycling water, and using floating fish feed to minimize waste and pollution. the fish are sold in the local market, and the initiative has created 100 jobs in a region with a high unemployment rate. at the same time, west african fish meets the heavy demand for protein-rich food of good quality in a country where most food is imported. west african fish are also active in the local community. they have built a local school, rebuilt the local market with a new water pump, and have also contributed skills and nets to the water research institute in ghana, helping to promote aquaculture practices in ghana. why you should care aquafarming has become an important additional means of seafood production at a time when over 53% of the world’s fisheries are fully exploited. west african fish saw strong early growth, going from producing 28 tons of fish in their first year to 4,000 six years later. as well as creating 100 jobs directly on the farm, this relatively small aquaculture practice estimates to have positively boosted the local economy, with indirect benefits for up to 400 local families.",https://goexplorer.org/green-fish-farming-fosters-local-growth/,SDG 14: Life Below Water,,14.5 Sustainable Seafood Solutions,,,,,,,,Ghana,Growth,Nascent,No,Unfunded,,N/A,,Lower middle income,Ghana,,,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,1,0,0,0.4,Nascent

sofi filtration,advanced filtration system enhances industrial water recycling,"sofi filtration has developed a low energy, automated water filter for treating industrial wastewater that requires no chemicals or disposable filters. the sofi filter is a fully-automated micro-filtration system for removing solid particles from industrial wastewater streams. sofi filters allow companies with large water requirements such as in the mining, construction or heat and power industries to treat and reuse their wastewater. this ultimately reduces the costs for these companies and the risks of contamination from wastewater streams. the sofi filter is self cleaning, which contributes to longevity, lowers maintenance demands and enhances filtering efficiency. in addition, the filters use no chemicals, and do not require any disposable filtering system alternatives such as cartridges or bags. sofi filters consume relatively low levels of energy, requiring 0.05 kwh/m³ of water that is treated. due to its modular design, the device is easily scalable, ranging in capacity form 0.5 to 280 m³/hr. at present, they are targeting firms in developed countries where governments may have introduced tariffs to create an economic incentive to reduce industrial wastewater discharge. for instance, in finland, companies pay around €3/m³ of water – including the cost of the water and the wastewater discharge cost. sofi filtration allows these firms to filter and reuse their wastewater for around 10% of that cost, meaning that the total volume of water they consume is much smaller. as a result of these cost savings, the payback period on the technology is short. why you should care in europe, heavy industry and energy production account for 40% of total water consumption , which increases competition for other uses such as agriculture and sanitation. technologies like the sofi filter can assist in increasing the proportion of wastewater that is recycled and reused, and help to alleviate the strain on water supply.",http://www.sofifiltration.com/sofi,SDG 9: Industry Innovation and Infrastructure,,9.2 Advanced technologies for sustainable industry,,,,,,,,europe,Unknown,Nascent,Yes,Series A,,N/A,,High income,Finland,,2011,,,Sustainia,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,0.5,0.33,0,0.398,Nascent

miljøskærm,noise barriers made from upcycled wind turbines,"the danish company miljøskærm has come up with a creative use for retired wind turbine blades – they recycle the fibreglass into sound barriers for busy roads in order to address noise pollution. wind turbines are typically made from fibreglass, due to its light weight and durability, but this composite material is usually landfilled because it is notoriously complex to recycle. miljøskærm collects the used blades and shreds the fibreglass material into small fibres. these fibres are then pressed together into sheets that are designed to be highly porous and therefore effective at absorbing noise. manufacturing noise barriers using recycled fibre glass also requires 40% less energy and generates 60% less overall co2 emissions than conventional products made from aluminium and mineral wool. the material has been trialled for noise pollution control in the copenhagen suburb of vallensbæk. the suburb has experienced significant growth in traffic in recent years, and now over 100,000 cars pass through each day. a miljøskærm sound barrier was installed in june 2016, and effectively brought noise pollution from 61 decibels to 54, bringing it well below the acceptable level of 58 decibels. why you should care miljøskærm is simultaneously addressing two issues. first, on a global scale it is expected that discarded wind turbine waste will exceed 150,000 tonnes annually by 2027 . finding a new purpose for this material is important for avoiding wasteful landfilling. second, the social and environmental consequences of excessive noise exposure in europe is estimated to cost €40 billion per year. noise pollution has been linked to sleep deprivation, stress, high blood pressure and more.",http://miljoskarm.dk/english/,SDG 9: Industry Innovation and Infrastructure,,9.2 Advanced technologies for sustainable industry,,,,,,,,Denmark,Unknown,Nascent,No,Unfunded,,N/A,,High income,Denmark,,2011,,,Sustainia,TRUE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,0.5,0,0,0.2,Nascent
